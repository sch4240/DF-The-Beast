  description: "It appeared again. It was watching me from the woods today. All night
    it would appear and then subsequently vanish, only for it to pop up again in some
    other place. I am sure it is not my imagination or my mind playing tricks on me
    or whatever bullshit I kept trying to tell myself! It can\u2019t be! Something
    is out there and it knows I am here. As I write this, I feel the steady pounding
    of my heart in my chest. Questions are racing through my head. What is it? Is
    it just an animal? Is it watching me as I write this down? I have no clue and
    that is making me crazy. Wait\u2026 I just heard something. It sounds like something
    crying out in pain\u2026 excruciating pain. It sounds like it is only a few yards
    away. I can\u2019t help but cringe at the thought of what might be happening.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    over now and it\u2019s quiet. I had to plug my ears until that wailing stopped.
    Nothing but silence now, almost deafening in its totality. Something about this
    silence is making me even more uneasy. Wait\u2026 I hear something. It was a thump
    of some kind. Possibly a tree branch hitting the cabin? I just realized that I
    was holding my breath, as if that would make these things stop. And then another
    thump. And now another one. It\u2019s\u2026 knocking. Is this thing toying with
    me?\r"
