  description: "Something had banged on the door as I was writing the last entry.
    The door had rattled in its frame and the resulting sound reverberated throughout
    the entire cabin. It happened again and again and it would not stop. I curled
    up in the corner and rocked back and forth as the banging grew more and more intense.
    And as it grew to an excruciating crescendo, I just yelled. I yelled for it to
    stop while trying to hold back my tears. I was desperate and I did not expect
    the noise to stop just because I yelled at it, but it did. The banging stopped.
    I should have been relieved, but the sudden stop just made me even more uneasy.
    Eventually I got the courage to walk to the door and peek out the peephole. Nothing.
    There was nothing. I don\u2019t think the wind could have caused the door to rattle
    in its frame like that, but there was nothing to be seen. It\u2019s been a few
    hours since anything strange like that has happened. I should be calmer now, but
    I have feeling that something terrible is coming that is filling me with dread.
    I am convinced that the ritual I performed accidentally summoned this beast. And
    as I was writing before the banging began to torment me, the last two numbers
    for the code to that awful room is 13."
