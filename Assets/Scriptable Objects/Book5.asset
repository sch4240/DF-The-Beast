  description: "It\u2019s been days since it appeared. I have decided that it is not
    of this world. I did not think my magic was ever this powerful, but I have truly
    summoned a demon. Some heartless piece of shit that just won\u2019t leave me alone.
    The ritual\u2026 I summoned it but I have no idea how to get rid of it. I have
    been poring over my books trying to figure out what I can do to combat this\u2026
    thing. First I have to figure out what type of creature it is, but nothing is
    helping. I think I might have to perform another ritual, but the circle is in
    the room that I locked and I can\u2019t remember the code! Pages from my journal
    are missing as well. It was the creature\u2019s doing. I am sure of it. It\u2019s
    toying with me, trying to make me insane. But i\u2019m not insane. I\u2019m perfectly
    sane. I won\u2019t let it get to me. I am sane. I am sane. I am sane. I am san.
    I am sane. I am sane. I am sane. I am sane. I am not insane. I am sane I am sane
