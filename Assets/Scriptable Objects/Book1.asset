  description: "I thought I saw something in the woods today. It was the shadow of\u2026
    something. I am not sure what. I remember feeling a sense of dread crashing down
    on me as I peered at the obscured figure for what seemed like an eternity. It
    did not move much from its spot but it seemed to wriggle like a squirming animal.
    As I stared at it, I heard something else that made my skin crawl. It was a blood-curdling
    shriek that reverberated through the still air. When I turned to look back where
    the shadow had been, it was gone. I have no idea what that thing was and for the
    past few hours I have been anxiously pacing about the cabin, deliberating about
    what I saw. I am still a bit shook up over this, even as I write this very sentence,
    my hand trembles ever so slightly. However, I have come to the conclusion that
    the shadow and the accompanying sound was just my mind playing tricks on me. If
    only for the sake of my sanity, I must convince myself that this is true. The
    stress of being alone in this cabin is finally getting to me. I believe I shall
    listen to the radio for a bit to calm my nerves. "
